# React-node-chatgpt-tutorial

# Description:

The React Node ChatGPT Sample project is a comprehensive example of integrating OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model into a real-time chat application.
This project demonstrates how to create a seamless chatbot experience using React on the front end and Node.js on the backend. It's a perfect starting point for developers who want to harness the power of AI for interactive and intelligent chat applications.

# Features:

Real-time Chat Interface: The project includes a user-friendly chat interface built with React that allows users to engage in conversations with a chatbot powered by GPT-3.5.

# Backend Server: 
A Node.js backend server handles communication between the front end and the OpenAI GPT-3.5 API. It manages user requests and responses, ensuring a smooth chat experience.

OpenAI Integration: The project demonstrates how to integrate OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model, enabling the chatbot to generate human-like responses based on user input. It showcases the capabilities of this cutting-edge language model.

Customizable Chatbot: Developers can easily customize the chatbot's behavior, responses, and personality traits by fine-tuning the parameters and instructions sent to the GPT-3.5 API.

# Frontend:
The front-end part is responsible for creating the user interface and handling user interactions. It's built using React and it provides a visually appealing and interactive chat interface for users to communicate with the chatbot.
The core component of the front end is the chat interface, which displays user and chatbot messages in a conversation-style format.
Users can type messages in an input field at the bottom of the chat interface.
The front end captures user input and sends it to the backend for processing through API requests to GPT-3.5.

# Getting Started:

To use this sample project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository from GitHub.
1. Set up your OpenAI API credentials and configure them in the backend.
2. Install the dependencies using npm both the frontend and backend.
3. Start the backend server by exectuing the following command in the backend folder `npm ./index.js`
4. Boot the react app by exectuing the following command in the front end folder `npm run run ./index.js`
